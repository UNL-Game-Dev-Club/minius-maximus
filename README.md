# Minius Maximus

A turn-based strategy puzzler made for the 2020 [K-State Game Jam](https://gdc.cs.ksu.edu/game-jam/).
You can freely change your stats during combat, but when one stat goes up, another must go down.

Fight your way through Gladiator High and defeat Principal Treebread!

## Instructions

- Use A and D to walk left and right down the hallway.
- Use W to jump (very useful).
- Click Reconfigure in combat to adjust your stats.
  Remember, to increase one stat, you have to lower another.
  What goes up, must come down!
- Click Fight in combat to attack your opponent.
    - You deal damage to your opponent equal to your strength minus half their defense, rounded down.
    - The opponent with the higher speed stat attacks first on any given turn.
- If you win a fight, you'll gain back stat points equal to your lost HP, plus two extra.
- If you lose a fight, you can retry with your stats from before the fight.
